1) Triggering the event
	Click the mouse button on a tile to spawn a zombie.

2) What happens
	The mouse click spawn a Zombie entity, turns the nearby grass and rocks to dead grass (with a hole in the ground at the spawn point), and slows nearby Miners.

3) Affected entities
	The affected entities, the Miners, are slowed by doubling their movement rate values.

4) The new entity
	The Zombie that spawns at the source of the mouse click will seek out Miners, using a simpler pathing algorithm that doesn't take into account any obstacles, so they act more like typical zombies. If a Zombie reaches a Miner, the Miner will be turned into a Zombie, and seek out other Miners.
